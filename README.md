# `send-fee-bundle.js` README

## Overview
This script is designed to submit a bundle of transactions to the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) via a specified API. It handles the generation of a fee transaction (to cover the BNB fee of user transactions) and a list of user-defined transactions (such as BNB transfers or contract calls). The transactions are then signed, bundled, and sent to a remote API.

## Requirements
- Node.js
- Web3.js
- Axios
